-- Fix Row Level Security policies for applications table
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- First, let's check if RLS is enabled on applications table
-- You can see this in the Supabase dashboard under Authentication > Policies

-- Option 1: Disable RLS temporarily (Quick fix - NOT recommended for production)
-- ALTER TABLE applications DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Option 2: Create proper RLS policies (Recommended)

-- Enable RLS if not already enabled
ALTER TABLE applications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies if they exist (to avoid conflicts)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "applications_insert_policy" ON applications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "applications_select_policy" ON applications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "applications_update_policy" ON applications;

-- Create policy to allow anyone to insert applications (for job seekers)
CREATE POLICY "applications_insert_policy" ON applications
    FOR INSERT 
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Create policy to allow companies to view their applications
CREATE POLICY "applications_select_policy" ON applications
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (
        -- Allow if authenticated user's company_id matches the application's company_id
        -- OR allow public read for basic functionality
        true
    );

-- Create policy to allow companies to update their applications
CREATE POLICY "applications_update_policy" ON applications
    FOR UPDATE 
    USING (
        -- Allow if authenticated user's company_id matches
        auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
    )
    WITH CHECK (
        auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
    );

-- If you also have a job_applications table, apply similar policies
-- Check if the table exists and apply policies
